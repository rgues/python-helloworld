    "HISTORY_PAGE_TEXT":"<p> The Stokvel takes its name from the Neapolitan banker Lorenzo de Tonti who in the search of a solution to the financial difficulties of France in his time, proposes to Mazarin that the people be invited to invest money in a common fund that will allow them to obtain a life annuity. De Tonti became therefore the founder of the Stokvel, an ancient version of life insurance. But in Africa, Stokvel existed long before the introduction of money into the economy. They are rooted in the distant history of the African people. In fact, Africans have long grouped together to work together successively in the field of each of each member of the community or to build houses one after the other in the village. They constituted in this way a Stokvel of work or could then constitute a Stokvel in kind to organize a party or to buy things that could not be bought alone. It was only more recently, when money began to circulate, that they constituted Stokvel of money.Today, Stokvel is an indispensable practice in Africa, it is very popular with African populations </p><h5>Definition</h5><p> The Stokvel is a rotating saving scheme made up of members or persons of a clan, a family, an association, neighbours, friends,colleagues, who decide to meet in more or less variable intervals in order to pool their savings, goods or services for the benefit  of everyone, each in his turn. This is in order to be able to attend problems of a personal or collective nature.</p><h5>Constitution</h5><p>Members who regroup always know each other in advance, and therefore, although membership is free, it is most often selective. In this case, we are talking about a closed Stokvel as opposed to an open Stokvel that can gather people who do not know each other in advance but decide to form a Stokvel on the initiative of one of these people.  A Stokvel or adherents of a Stokvel can sponsor someone from their entourage. But the predominant factor remains the affiliation of the members and therefore the trust, which often constitutes a guarantee of security. The geographical area can be very wide, and the size can vary enormously. Similarly, a Stokvel may be mixed, or may consist of only men or only women But the composition of the Stokvel and its size obviously play a fundamental role with regard to the criteria of confidence and safety. </p><h5>Contributions</h5><p>The participants pay according to the periods that have been defined, an amount concluded between the participants in a common pot that constitutes at the end of each round the money pool This money pool is distributed in turn to each member in predetermined order, alphabetical draw, random draw, or the pool can be auctioned so that the member who is most in need can take it. These auctions winnings generates at the end of the cycle interest for participants These interests will be redistributed to each participant in accordance with his or her tontinary participation. Of course there are cases where a member can have several shares, thus increasing his ability to save and allowing him to receive more than once the money pool. It should be noted that the first member to receive the pot receives an interest-free loan, while the last to receive it saves throughout the cycle.</p><h5>Duration</h5><p>This one is very variable. The Stokvel is constituted for a cycle, renewable by tacit renewal. So a stovel can be unlimited if the participants so decide, or it can stop after a full turn for such or such a reason Some Stokvel try to protect themselves against social risks such as death, illness, changes of residence, ...and they take precautions from the constitution of the Stokvel (bonds, Avals, provisions, etc.). It can also be stressed that sometimes too long a cycle can lead to weariness of participants, which leads to resignations or missed payments. </p><h5>Funding</h5><p>Only the contributions from the participants of the Stokvel make it possible to finance it. Stokvel is not enhanced or enriched by contributions outside the participants circle The constitution of a foresight pot makes it possible to cope with certain additional costs that may arise during the cycle. This pot (also called a pot or piggy bank) is fed either by a down payment which is not subsequently redistributed, or by a payment during the cycle which is requested from the participants in case of need.</p><h5>Meeting</h5><p>Meetings are held every round. They may take place at the Stokvel's President house but are most often carried out at one or the other of the participant's house in turn. It is during these meetings that decisions are made, most often in the form of consensus. The meeting is generally an opportunity to spend a pleasant moment, allowing to exchange information, to talk about his business, his projects , his worries... Sometimes meetings are also an opportunity to solve the internal problems of Stokvel.</p> <p>Attendance at these meetings is sometimes mandatory, and punctuality is required. Otherwise, a penalty may be applied either in kind or in cash. Attendance at meetings is considered a moral duty, and failure to do so can lead to a loss of confidence in the group. Likewise, discipline is the rule at meetings, if this discipline is not respected, the censor may be led to impose a fine on the perpetrator of the disorder.</p><h5>Closure of the Stokvel</h5><p>To mark the end of the Stokvel, a big party is usually organized (But parties also take place throughout the Stokvel). The end of the Stokvel is at the same time the beginning of the next one, and the participants take this opportunity to develop the conditions in which they will keep the association alive.</p> <h5>Purpose of the African Stokvel</h5><p> The lack of access to the banking system makes the tontinier system almost vital. It acts as a micro-credit, open to loved ones. Each of the individuals can in turn borrow in the Stokvel, provided to reimburse. The rotating combination of savings and credit therefore refers to the system whereby individuals borrow in turn and then pay back. </p> <h5>The role of Stokvel can be:</h5><p><b>Social</b></p><p>The role of Stokvel is primarily social in African countries. Stokvel favours the group over the individual, and can dictate behaviours. It is often used as a provident fund, to which each member adheres in anticipation of risks that may arise (e.g., illness, death, tuition fees, etc.). The Stokvel is a social cover that acts in the family circle, friendship or even professional.The Stokvel gives a special emphasis to collective solidarity and mutual aid which is a great African value. Depending on the group of Stokvel, it can promote exchanges of ideas.</p><p><b>Economic</b></p><p>In this case,the objective is to use the funds for short-term investments, for planned or unpredictable events, collectively or individually. In case of individual use, the individual wishing to borrow must first present his project, which must be accepted by the rest of the participants. The use of the funds is sometimes monitored by a designated partner of the association. In other cases, the individual may just borrow for personal reasons, however by providing guarantees in the form of sponsorship or endorsement by another member of the group. </p><p><b>Financial</b></p> <p>The Stokvel can mobilise savings, in this case it has a financial role. Stokvel has the particularity of involving a periodic contribution. These periodic contributions may be awarded on a rotating basis to the participant who needs them most, or in the case of a predetermined order (Alphabetical or Random Draw), although there is also the possibility of exchanging or buying a turn at auction according to defined terms.</p>",
